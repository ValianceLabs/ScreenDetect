# ScreenDetect Hub
Welcome to the **ScreenDetect Hub**! This central portal gives you instant access to free, professional-grade browser tools for testing, diagnosing, and repairing display issues on any device—no downloads, no signups, 100% free.

Visit the full suite at **[ScreenDetect.com](https://screendetect.com)**.

## Core Display Testing Tools
Start detecting issues in seconds with our most popular diagnostic tools:

- **[Pixel Test](https://screendetect.com/tests/pixel-test)** – Identify dead pixels, stuck pixels, hot pixels, and other defects using 10 comprehensive color patterns. Quick 30-120 second scans with repair guidance.
- **[Backlight Bleed Test](https://screendetect.com/tests/backlight-bleed-test)** – Check for light leakage, IPS glow, and bleed severity on dark backgrounds. Assess severity and learn realistic fix options.
- **[All Testing Tools](https://screendetect.com/tests)** – Full suite: pixel anomalies, uniformity, gradients, motion ghosting, color accuracy, and more. Works on LCD, LED, OLED, AMOLED across monitors, laptops, phones, and tablets.

> Run tests in a dark room, at max brightness, for accurate results. Use findings to decide on repairs or warranty claims.

## Core Display Repair Tools
Attempt non-invasive software-based fixes right in your browser. Our repair tools target electrical issues (like stuck pixels) before considering costly hardware interventions:

- **[Stuck Pixel Fixer](https://screendetect.com/repairs/stuck-pixel-fixer)** – Rapidly cycle red, green, and blue colors to unstick frozen pixels (colored or white/hot dots). 60-80% success rate—most fixes in 5-30 minutes; extend to 1-8 hours for stubborn cases. Safe for modern displays (OLED users: take breaks every 2-3 hours).

> Always test first with our Pixel Test tool to confirm stuck (fixable) vs. dead (permanent). Clean screen, disable sleep/screensaver, and run in fullscreen. Stop if no improvement after 8 hours—likely dead pixel.

## Coming Soon & Resources
We're expanding the repair suite and overall diagnostics:
- Advanced pixel/flashing sequences for tougher cases
- Touchscreen responsiveness calibration & fixes
